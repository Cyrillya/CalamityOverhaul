重要的新配置：
在模组设置中，
设置‘弹匣系统’选项可以选择关闭枪械弹匣系统内容，但需要注意，如果您选择关闭，那么远程武器的游戏平衡不再具有讨论意义
设置‘武器手持显示’选项可以选择是否开关灾厄大修自带的手持动画，在目前版本，这个配置主要影响远程武器的视觉效果

以下弓类被二次重做调整以适配新框架：
啸流，荒芜弓，瘟疫，猎人长弓，荆棘藤，化石病，幻魔，湮灭千星，幽漩风暴，风暴
特殊改动：移除幻魔的特殊拉弓动画转而使用通用拉弓动作，因为这个特殊的弓弦动画并不适合游戏风格

Key New Configurations:
In the mod settings,
the 'Magazine System' option can be toggled to deactivate the magazine system for firearms. However, it's worth noting that opting to disable it renders the balance of ranged weapons meaningless for discussion.
the 'Weapon Handheld Display' option allows toggling the default handheld animations provided by Calamity Overhaul. In the current version, this configuration primarily affects the visual effects of ranged weapons.

The following bows have been revamped to fit the new framework:
Alluvion, Barren Bow, Contagion, Marksman Bow, Nettlevine Great Bow, Petrified Disease, Phangasm, Planetary Annihilation, The Maelstrom, The Storm
Special adjustment: Removed unique drawing animation for Phantasm, now using a generic drawing motion, as the unique bowstring animation didn't suit the game's style.

The majority of firearms are no longer affected by ammo consumption bonuses. Related ammo consumption bonus mechanisms, such as set bonuses or potion effects, will be reworked into new content in future updates.
Flak Toxi cannon now directly limits firing angles.
Barren Bow utilizes new textures.
Optimized Divine Source Blade's usage animation.
Temporarily removed Allhallows Gold Whip, as unfinished weapons are not suitable for inclusion in the game.
Enhanced cobblestone and flint tools.
The chance of Petrified Disease dropping from the Destroyer has been reduced from 100% to 20%.

Bug Fixes:
Fixed numerous issues with crit rate inheritance for bows.
Resolved abnormalities in some text descriptions.
Fixed animation glitches for Neutron ingots in the world.
Fixed Endless Catalyst not playing animations in the world.

Balance Adjustments:
Ataraxia's panel reduced from 432 to 305, moved to post-Divine Devourer era.
Nadir's panel reduced from 365 to 180, moved to post-Divine Devourer era.
Excelsus's panel reduced from 250 to 220, slightly increased attack speed.
Divine Source Blade panel reduced back to 385 from 405, slightly increased blade size, sword beam penetration reduced from 7 to 5,

Blighted Cleaver's energy consumption rate increased by 200%, base panel reduced from 64 to 60, number of true melee summoned jungle sickles reduced from 8 to 4,
number of penetrating sickles from Overloaded Cleaver reduced from 3 to 2, slightly slowed attack speed in overloaded state.
Defiled Great Sword reduces number of sickles launched in charged state from 3 to 2.
Entropic Claymore damage coefficient adjusted from 0.6/0.8/1 to 0.3/0.5/1, but projectiles can fully inherit weapon crit bonuses.
Comet Quasher reduces number of true melee summoned meteors by 50%.
Voidragon bullet eruption damage reduced by 50%. A shot that hits an enemy will grow a void touch in place
Shroomer's firing rate decreased, weapon panel reduced from 150 to 135, base panel for mushroom homing projectiles reduced from 100% weapon panel to 70% weapon panel.
