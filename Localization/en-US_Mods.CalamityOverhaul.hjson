			'''

			In the shadowed realms of Terra, the once radiant warrior goddess, Alina,
			now finds herself plunged into an endless abyss of chaos and despair, emerging as the whispered harbinger known as the Storm Goddess.
			Once, she stood as an unmatched warrior on the continent, her fearless courage and razor-sharp blade commanding a serene sky like lightning.
			However, the shadows of fate began to creep beneath her feet. In the twilight clash between light and darkness, as heaven crumbled and darkness consumed the remnants, 
			the Storm Goddess bore witness to the cruelty of the Supreme Deity. The arrogant god stripped her of comrades, kin, and obliterated all she had once sheltered.
			The sins of the Supreme Deity cast doubts upon her once unwavering faith in justice, leading her to descend into the unfathomable abyss of corruption.
			As the embers of war settled, Alina returned to Terra, but she was no longer the valiant warrior of yore.
			The internal agony and boundless despair propelled her to forsake the lofty beliefs she once held, seeking a new wellspring of power. 
			In a gruesome ritual, she obtained the forbidden blessing – an influx of boundless power, paid for with the eternal corruption of her soul.
			Now, the Storm Goddess stands as an emblem of abyssal descent, her armor adorned with obsidian akin to a night sky, 
			eyes shimmering with the corruptive radiance. The chaotic currents surge, projecting malice towards Terra. Her blade,
			a thunderous force in the obsidian night, dances with arcs of annihilative power. No longer fighting for justice, she has become a force set on obliterating all.
			Though she retains the martial prowess of yore, she is now the nemesis of Terra, scorned by countless tongues. 
			The Storm Goddess cruelly embarks on a solitary and corruptive journey, lingering in the shadows. Her very existence mocks the bygone glory of Terra,
			a tempest consuming every vestige of hope.
			As a fallen star plunges into the abyss, she blossoms in the boundless darkness, carrying the universe's sorrow and destruction."

			O shattered god, permit me to atone for my sins. 
			The war has sprawled across centuries, and I, a fugitive fleeing the grand civilization,
			eke out a meager existence on this desolate planet at the edge of the universe.
			Thousands of light-years away, the colossal war machines of conflict grind stars to dust.
			Savage and dreadful assaults erase light-years of stellar expanse in the blink of an eye, transforming it into a domain of silence.
			For countless centuries, this war has raged on. Now, the mighty civilization to which I belong teeters on the brink,
			and I shall become a cosmic sinner, the most disrespectful blasphemer.
			My flesh has decayed, my bones mirroring the wrinkles of passing ages. 
			I am on the verge of becoming one of the feeble machines I created. 
			Before that fate befalls me, may the gods grant me forgiveness and pardon my disrespect towards this supreme being. 
			Let me descend into the abyss of purgatory, enduring endless torment as my soul falls.
			Yet, for the sake of my civilization, for victory in this war spanning centuries, I must harness the fragmented power of this godly entity.
			To guide its mysterious force, I have no choice but to infuse its shattered divine form with the cold embrace of machinery.
			This is an inevitable sacrilege. For the continuity of civilization, for the triumph of war, 
			I must become the most devout follower of this supreme entity, the most disrespectful blasphemer in history.

			Hey, rookie, there's a slimy blue blob up ahead, or bugs deep in the desert, and that zombie crab in the mushroom cave. Your mission is to prove yourself; this is your first step.
			As night falls, that big eyeball shows up. Pop it! Or the seafloor shells in the desert—don't be soft.
			It's time to chop down that blob of brain flowers or that purple long bug. I want to see your blade dancing in the chaos.
			There's something at the dungeon entrance, take care of it. And those corrupted heretics, make sure they're completely quiet.
			Remember that blob of blue slime? Now it's time to take down its boss.
			The ones wielding ice and fire, or that mechanical heretic, or the heavily corrupted sea creature—cut them down!
			The sulphur fire eyeball at night, or giant sea monsters, and that stone golem—stab them all.
			Take down the spreading corrupted ones and their offspring wandering in the jungle, or that fleshy statue, or the giant worm roaming the stars—cut them all!
			The disciples of the pseudo-sun god, wandering in sacred places or hell, or that silly bird in the jungle—pick one and deal with it.
			Plenty of choices, rookie. The pseudo-sun god, the cosmic disciples, or the extradimensional remnants in the dungeon. Let's meet them.
			Kill that arrogant worm! Or just chop up the highly corrupted fish
			The fire-playing aberration, don't be soft—smash it!
			Go meet the mechanical heretic or the fallen witch, and take care of these heretic offspring!
			The dragon ahead, smash it, or go straight into battle!
			Well done, rookie.

			This is but a fragment of the plan.
			In the enduring pursuit of knowledge, in the intricate thirst for understanding, I, the sanctified harbinger of cunning and peculiarity, remain unbounded by constraints.
			In the dark cosmos, I am the embodiment of endless conspiracies and betrayals.
			The chaotic forces shall consume all, be it the essence of the mind or the soul.
			Embrace the void, bathe in the flames of chaos, and therein shall you discover the true power.
			I am the fallen prophet, orchestrating the dance of departed souls within my grasp.
			Fear is but the manifestation of the feeble; true strength welcomes the advent of chaos.
			Amidst the storm of chaos, only the mightiest of souls can endure.
			The boundless abyss calls to you; plunge into it bravely, become a faithful servant of chaos.
			Sacred order is but a fragile illusion; the authentic essence of the universe lies in chaos.
			Deception and treachery are the tools of chaos, and I am its devoted envoy.
			Only in the crucible of chaos can one forge an indomitable warrior.
			The boundless sea of chaos awaits the voyage of the courageous.
			Resistance against chaos is a futile struggle; ultimately, every soul will succumb to its power.
			The radiance of divine glory is but a fleeting illusion before the onset of chaos.
			Beneath the veil of chaos lies infinite power and boundless wisdom.
			In the domain of chaos, lies are more truthful than truths.
			Betrayal is the gift of chaos, and I am the herald of cunning.
			In the darkness of chaos, I have unearthed a power mightier than any deity.
			The enemy's fear of chaos is merely a display of ignorance; true wisdom aligns with chaos.
			The universe is a stage for chaos and transformation, and I am its lead conductor.
			In the abyss of the psyche, find boundless fervor, transcending all constraints.
			Truth is ever-changing; only in falsehood can genuine liberation be discovered.
			The universe is a vast chessboard, and I am the player manipulating the pieces.
			The false order is a mere evasion of the genuine truth; I choose to confront the unknown truth.
			Rebellion is resistance against constraints; it is the sole path to freedom.
			Discover light in the darkness, not through prayers but through betrayal.
			The abyss of the psyche is more mysterious than the universe's darkness, and I am deeply ensnared within it.
			In every act of betrayal, there is an ascent of power, surpassing all limitations.
			Sacred rules are but false restraints, and I choose to shatter these shackles.
			Embark courageously on the journey into the unknown; betrayal shall be your most faithful companion.
			Beneath the facade of falsity, endless opportunities await discovery.
			I am the standard-bearer in the darkness, guiding seekers of truth toward the unknown abyss.
			Against tradition, break free from the shackles to truly find the source of power.
			In the boundless sea of lies, find the true power; such is the creed of cunning.
			Conform not to rules, but break them to leave an indelible mark upon the universe.
			In the tide of change, betrayal stands as the sole immortal symbol.
			In the false radiance, uncover the true essence of darkness; this is the power I seek.
			'''
		Destruct_TextContent:
			'''
			You pitiful fabricators, believing that through deceit you can pilfer power? 
			Brazenly mocking the rules, arrogantly thinking you can elude the judgment of the Warp? 
			Absurd! In the storm of chaos, you are but insignificant dust, to be devoured by the recklessness you so proudly exhibit. 
			Attempting to gain power through deception, you shall unquestionably become sacrifices in the crucible of chaos. 
			Chaos does not welcome cowards, especially those ludicrous beings attempting to subvert the established order. 
			Your ludicrous endeavors only serve to make chaos more potent, leading you to ultimately become sacrifices to the endless darkness. 
			Deceiver, your schemes are nothing more than the jests of a clown in the chaotic circus. 
			The rules are the symphony of the cosmos, and you are nothing but crows ignorant of the beat. 
			Seeking to usurp power through cheating? Chaos will treat your tactics as nothing more than child's play. 
			Cowards struggling in the darkness, your existence is not worth mentioning, merely midnight snacks for chaos. 
			Trying to overthrow the rules? You are nothing more than colorful maze mice in the vastness of the cosmos, destined for a dead end. 
			Chaos fears no challenge, and scorns those clowns who take pride in deceit. 
			The conspiracy of cheating is like smoke, destined to dissipate in the storm of chaos. 
			Cowards, your arrogance is but a feeble ripple in the tidal wave of chaos. 
			The universe's order is woven ropes, yet you absurdly attempt to sever them. 
			Absurd ones, the laughter of chaos will echo in your collapse; you are but fleeting moments in the darkness.
